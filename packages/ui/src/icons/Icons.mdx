# Icons
Flowfixe Components doesn't have a custom built-in icon. The icons used by our components are from the [Iconoir project](https://iconoir.com/).

Here is an example of usage:

<Fish style={{ fontSize: '16px', color: '#08c' }} />

```jsx
import { Fish } from "@flowfixe/components/icons"
<Fish style={{ fontSize: '16px', color: '#08c' }} />
```
